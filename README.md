# Crypto

Simple project that decrypt/encrypt from one base to other.
Just simply paste your text on left side chose what ur encrypt from end what you wanna to decrypt it.

This project contains 11 different base types, most popular will be Binary (Base 2), Octal (Base 8), Hex(Base 16), Decimal (Base 10)

I also use some others like Base 64 witch give user some more characters to use.
And my own created bases like "crypto" witch is a Base 8

In future i wanna make it compatible with ASCII and file encrypting/decrypting.
